DiscBot Control



Do you want to check your DiscBot, without missing a component, in a short of time?

If true, this software might help!



This Software offers:

-The "dbosX.hex" program for ATmega2560 to test the DiscBot

-Flashing your DiscBot with avrdude

-An integrated guideline for flashing at the first time

-Testing the many components of the DiscBot

-Sheet of the results called "checkSheet.txt"

-A written time into sheet of the results

-A written send and recive into sheet of the results

-Creation of multiple directories for a good structure

-Savesd results of motor testing

-An offline menue, which can change settings without plug in your DiscBot

-A lot of sheets to save data and reduce time of typing

-Presets for bluetooth

-Presets for motor

-Preferences for motor

-Automatic open the sheets if there mistakes in them

-Automatic generate of content of sheets for easy understanding and change

-Easy handling with files, complicated content can be easy understand because of examples

-Automatic links open for Apps (Android and IOS)

-Color, tone and sound (sound might not be stabile at PC)

-Inputdata error detection (eg. if there is a number expected and you type in a letter (work fine))

-Flush if wrong input is typed in

-Yes/no requests while the recommend awnser is choosen if there is a wrong imput (by old commands, but might happend)

-Easy interface to handle with

-Great advanced motor testing with an nice overview

-Secure communication to DiscBot (this program handles a lot of callbacks from DiscBot)

-DBOS compatiblity (9600 Baud on UART0, UART1, UART2(Bluetooth is not everytime compatible because of BT configurations (AT commands) and UART3))

-Bluetooth testing (might be a need of BLE terminal on smartphone)

-Easy BT configuration list

-Easy BT configuration changeing

-Compatiblity with a lot of BT modules because dynamical change of data can be made, in order to use other modules

-Possibility of compatibility with MLT-BT05 (BLE V4.1), JDY-31-SPP (Bluetooth Classic) and HMSoft (BLE V540) software

-Possibility to add compatibility of other BT modules

-If your bluethooth module isn't working, flash it with ccLoader

-3 BT modules are initialized by default

-An explicit motor analysis

-Presets for motor analysis

-32 sounds for loudspeaker testing

-102 volume modes for loudspeaker testing (including standard and mute)

-Good stability, more than 7316 lines of code provide a secure executation (a lot of debuging was required)

-Colorsensor testing, LED testing, ultrasonic sensor testing, button testing, motor testing, loudspeaker testing, LDR testing (8 Bit), IRS testing, BT testing, RFID, IRC testing and other features

-Windows 64 bit (for faster executation)



Warning!!

	if the file of the programm has a different name as it says in the program, flashing is impossible!!



Needed:

A DiscBot (assembled or in parts, but at least with ATmega2560)

USB Hub cable

A Windows computer (64 bit)

At least 1.5 Mega Byte discspace without software as WinAvr

WinAvr

-Software and folder-structure is delivert in this program and will be autogenerated
